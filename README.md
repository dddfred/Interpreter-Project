# Interpreter Fall/2022
Java-based project in which I had to come up with an interpreter for a toy language

# WHAT I LEARNED
I learned how to make a tokenizer and a parser for the toy language using Java regex library. The project can analyze, report syntax errors, report uninitialized variables, and do computations.
